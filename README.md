# Face Recognition App

![Face Recognition](https://img.shields.io/badge/Face%20Recognition-Python-blue.svg)

A real-time face recognition application built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and the UID Python library. The project supports custom dataset training and real-time face recognition.

## Features

- **Custom Data Training**: Train the model using a custom dataset to recognize specific faces.
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Identify and recognize faces from live webcam footage or static images.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for training deep learning models.
- **Visualization**: Training accuracy and loss graphs using Matplotlib.
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses OpenCV for efficient face detection and UID library for enhanced identification.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and face detection)
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (for deep learning and model training)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing training results)
- **UID Python Library** (for unique identification and recognition)
